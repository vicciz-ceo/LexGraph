# US statute fixtures (sprint 2026-08-02-us-state-law, ruling R6)

Two files, same 3 REAL rows (all 24 original parquet columns, values
unmodified) out of `vaquill/open-us-law`'s `us_de_statutes.parquet` file:

- `de_sample_rows.json` — for any test that only needs to read the row data
  (no `pyarrow` install required). This is what the deterministic-engine
  tests (`test_definition_links_us_profile.py`,
  `test_us_profile_definitions_section_end_to_end.py`) use.
- `de_sample_rows.parquet` — a REAL, byte-valid Parquet file (10.5 KB,
  written from the exact same 3 rows via `pyarrow.Table.from_pylist` +
  `pyarrow.parquet.write_table`, round-trip-verified byte-identical back to
  `de_sample_rows.json`) — for the dataset-ingester item's CLI/parquet-
  reading tests, so they exercise a REAL local parquet file without
  downloading the 21 MB real one. **Caveat**: because all 3 sample rows
  happen to have `null` for `chapter_name` and `last_amended_year`, pyarrow
  infers those two columns as the `null` type in THIS fixture, not the real
  file's actual `string`/`int64` types -- the ingester must handle the real
  file's typing, not assume this fixture's degenerate schema for those two
  columns specifically.

Rows picked to cover the cases named in the sprint contract's R6:

1. **`STATE_DE_T5_C7_SVIII_S796`** — a real "Definitions" section (`§ 796`,
   Delaware Code Title 5). Multi-term, numbered-subsection body using
   `"Term" has the meaning specified in ...` as its definition idiom (not
   `"Term" means ...`), with BOTH a same-chapter internal cross-reference
   (`§ 770 of this chapter`) and two federal cross-references
   (`12 U.S.C. § 1841(k)`, `12 U.S.C. § 1813(c)`). Covers G2 (Definitions
   detection) and half of G4 (citation grammar).
2. **`STATE_DE_T29_C60A_S6060`** — NOT a Definitions section (heading is
   "Employer Match Plan"); short body containing a clean U.S.C. citation
   (`26 U.S.C. § 401(a)`). Covers G4 in isolation from G2.
3. **`STATE_DE_T31_C52_SIII_S5227`** — the edge case: a one-sentence
   cross-TITLE reference (`as defined in § 901 of Title 10` — a different
   law/title than this section's own Title 31), which is the US analogue of
   the Hebrew engine's cross-law derivation (`derivation.py`). Its own
   section heading ("Definition.", singular) is also a definitions-heading
   variant distinct from row 1's plural "Definitions.".

## A real data-quality issue this fixture surfaces (not injected)

**Every** row pulled from `us_de_statutes.parquet` (not just these three —
verified across all 21,649 rows) has a `section_title` value corrupted by a
double-encoding/scrape artifact: the literal section-symbol-plus-nbsp
sequence renders as `"§ Â\r\n        796. Definitions."` (mojibake `Â`, a
raw CR/LF, and indentation whitespace, all before the actual section number
and heading text). An English "Definitions"-heading matcher that assumes a
clean `"796. Definitions"`-shaped string (mirroring the Hebrew engine's
`_DEFINITIONS_HEADING_RE`, which matches at the START of an already
marker-stripped heading) will not match this heading verbatim — the US
profile's heading detector must either tolerate/strip this noise or match
on a substring/contains basis. This is the "edge case" R6 asks for; it did
not need to be hand-picked, it is the norm for this file.

## Retrieval (fixture creation only — never run by the test suite, R6)

```
backend/.venv/bin/python -c "
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download
p = hf_hub_download(repo_id='vaquill/open-us-law', filename='us_de_statutes.parquet', repo_type='dataset')
import pyarrow.parquet as pq
t = pq.read_table(p)
print(t.schema)
print(t.slice(0, 3).to_pylist())
"
```

`huggingface_hub`/`pyarrow` are NOT installed in `backend/.venv` as of this
sprint (verified `ModuleNotFoundError` for both, plus `pandas`) — the
Planner fetched these rows using a disposable venv outside the repo
(`pip install huggingface_hub pyarrow` into a scratch venv), never touching
`backend/.venv` or `backend/pyproject.toml`. Adding `huggingface_hub`/
`pyarrow` as real dependencies (dev or production, per what the ingester
needs) is the Developer's job for the G6 (dataset ingester) item.

## Provenance

- Source: `vaquill/open-us-law` (HF dataset), file `us_de_statutes.parquet`,
  dataset commit `d2d760358de8bea543f016c226ad979b0adf2a85` (same sha the
  recon dossier's §4 verified via the HF API), fetched 2026-08-02.
- Format: JSON (not parquet) — deliberate choice so RED/regression tests
  that load this fixture never need `pyarrow` installed just to read three
  rows; the schema (24 string/int/JSON-string columns) is fully preserved
  as JSON types (`null` for the source's nulls, JSON-encoded-string values
  kept as-is for `breadcrumb`/`cross_references_usc`/`cross_references_cfr`/
  `public_laws_referenced`, matching the parquet column's actual on-disk
  type — these are strings containing JSON, not native list columns).
- License: CC-BY-4.0 (dataset), underlying statutory text public domain
  (government edicts doctrine) — per dossier §4.
- Why Delaware specifically: the existing frontend test fixture already
  uses `"US-DE"` as its jurisdiction literal
  (`frontend/src/pages/__tests__/AssertionDetailPage.test.tsx:80`) — reusing
  the same state keeps the sprint's fixtures consistent end-to-end.
