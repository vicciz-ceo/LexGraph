# Panel log — Sprint 2026-08-04-defs-us-pr (Puerto Rico, Spanish)

Append-only. Panel mode (program P-R3 / director order): Planner, Developer and
QA speak with one another THROUGH the sprint manager; every exchange is recorded
here. Escalations that the panel cannot settle go to the program manager.

---

## 2026-08-04 — Manager: sprint open, workspace ready

**Workspace.** Worktree `/Users/nerya/LexGraph-wt/defs-us-pr` on branch
`claude/defs-us-pr`, created from `origin/main` (`83532fe`). Own backend venv
built (`python3.13`, `pip install -e '.[dev]'`, exit 0, Python 3.13.12) — the
main checkout's venv is NOT usable here (known worktree trap). Git identity
verified: `256402398+vicciz-ceo@users.noreply.github.com`. Nobody on this panel
works in `/Users/nerya/LexGraph` (program manager owns it).

**CodeGraph.** The `.codegraph/` index lives in the main checkout only. All
agents run `codegraph explore "<question>"` from `/Users/nerya/LexGraph`
(read-only) or pass `projectPath=/Users/nerya/LexGraph` to the MCP tool. The
index was built at `origin/main`, which is exactly what this worktree is based
on, so it is current for pre-sprint code.

**Manager's own live re-confirmation of the recon premise** (worktree venv,
real code, not "the dossier said so"):

```
PR in registry: True
profile: USProfile  code=US-PR
is_definitions_heading('Artículo 3. Definiciones') -> False
is_definitions_heading('Section 3. Definitions')   -> True
```

So PR resolves to the generic English `USProfile` and its real Spanish
Definiciones headings are invisible. Recon §6/B3b premise holds.

**Core-sprint coordination status.** `origin/claude/defs-core-scope` exists at
`5b93ef8` ("acquire planner lock, open panel log, record C5 baseline"). Its
contract names a `## Seam spec (published)` section as the core Planner's FIRST
deliverable, but that section is **not yet present**. Per the sprint contract's
Coordination clause this panel plans and authors RED tests meanwhile, and polls
`git fetch origin && git show origin/claude/defs-core-scope:docs/sprint/sprints/2026-08-04-defs-core-scope.md`.

**Manager note for the Planner (not a finding, a lead):** the HF snapshot also
contains `us_pr_constitutions.parquet` alongside `us_pr_statutes.parquet`. The
sprint contract scopes this sprint to the statutes file (23,636 rows). If the
constitutions file carries definition-bearing Spanish text, that is an
out-of-contract observation to report, not to silently absorb.

## 2026-08-04 — Planner: full-corpus survey detail, seam proposal, item plan, RED tests

**Environment.** Worktree venv already has `pyarrow==25.0.0` installed
(`backend/.venv/bin/pip list`) — unlike the 2026-08-02 sprint's venv, no
disposable scratch venv was needed to read the parquet file; still never
read from anything under `backend/tests` (all survey scripts live in the
scratchpad, not the repo). CodeGraph used for all code understanding
(`profiles.py`, `us_profile.py`, `pipeline.py`, `matcher.py`, `extract.py`)
before any Read — one `codegraph explore` call each replaced what would
otherwise have been several grep+Read round trips.

**Core seam poll** (re-run at survey time, same result as the manager's
entry above): `origin/claude/defs-core-scope` is at `5b93ef8`; its
contract's `## Seam spec (published)` heading exists with no body. Not
blocking — planned and authored RED tests against the Planner's own
proposed interfaces, with the one genuinely core-blocked test file
(`test_pr_profile_scope.py`, P3) explicitly `xfail`-marked with the poll
command and reasoning in its own docstring.

### Survey detail (full tables; contract has the dense summary)

**Heading variant census** (652 `defini`-substring rows → 635 genuine after
excluding the `Aportaciones Definidas`/`sentencia definitiva`/stray-verb-form
false positives):

| Bucket | Count | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Bare `DEFINICIONES` (post-prefix-strip, plural) | 463 | e.g. `STATE_PR_LEY_249_2003_ART3` |
| Bare `DEFINICIÓN` (singular) | 10 | |
| Bare `(DEFINICIONES)` (parenthesized) | 2 | |
| Compound heading (Definici* embedded in longer text) | 160 | incl. Civil-Code `"X; definición"` single-term style |
| `section_title` > 120 chars (truncated-into-body artifact) | 9 | 1.4% of 635; real example dumped below |
| False positives excluded | 17 | 12 `Definidas`, 2 `definitiva`, 3 other |

**Idiom candidate frequency** (rows containing ≥1 match; corpus-wide n=23,636
/ within 635 canonical rows) — corrected, final numbers:

| Idiom | Corpus-wide rows | Canonical-section rows |
|---|---|---|
| `significa` | 596 | 322 |
| `significará` | 340 | 119 |
| `significan` | 12 | 6 |
| `significarán` | 19 | 10 |
| `se entenderá por` | 62 | 9 |
| `se entiende por` | 15 | 2 |
| `se entenderán por` | 5 | 1 |
| `quiere decir` | 7 | 3 |
| `tendrá el significado` | 15 | 7 |
| `tendrán el significado` | 309 | 238 |
| `tendrá(n) los significados` | 71 | 60 |
| `denota` | 1 | 1 |
| `comprende` | 145 | 24 |
| `incluye` | 2,350 | 233 |
| `se define`/`se define como` | 398 / 23 | 85 / 13 |
| `definido como` | 24 | 8 |
| `según se define` | 265 | 54 |

Headline: `significa(rá/n)` (322+119+6+10=457 canonical rows) and
`tendrá(n) el/los significado(s)` (7+238+60=305 canonical rows) are
CO-DOMINANT — the recon's lead named only `significa` (1,006 in a 4,000-row
sample) and `se entenderá por` (26) as its top signals; `se entenderá por`
is real but a minor idiom (9/635 canonical rows) compared to the
`tendrá(n) el/los significado(s)` family the recon's guess-based lead missed
entirely.

**Entry marker shapes** (within 635 canonical rows, ≥2 occurrences required
to count as a genuine list, not a coincidental single hit — regex required
a preceding `[.;]\s` or start-of-string, since bodies have zero newlines):

| Marker shape | Rows (≥1) | Rows (≥2, genuine list) |
|---|---|---|
| `(a)` letter-full-paren | 299 | 272 |
| `(1)` digit-full-paren | 121 | 109 |
| `a)` letter-close-paren-only | 87 | 82 |
| `1.` digit-period | 51 | 44 |
| `a.` letter-period | 41 | 34 |
| `1)` digit-close-paren-only | 18 | 13 |

461/635 (72.6%) have ≥1 genuine list marker of these 6 shapes; 174/635
(27.4%) have none (single-entry Civil-Code-style articles, or a marker shape
not yet catalogued — flagged as residual risk for QA's P4 sweep). Of those
174, 20 start with a repeated-term + em-dash single-inline-entry shape
(`"Term. — Definition"`).

Quote style within canonical bodies: curly `“”` 437/635, straight `"` 76/635,
mojibake byte-corruption (`\x80\x9c` etc., or `�`) **0/635 and 0/23,636
corpus-wide** — confirmed PR does NOT share RI's mojibake defect.

**Scope phrase census** (corpus-wide / within 635 canonical rows, `\b`-
boundary-corrected):

| Phrase | Corpus-wide | Canonical |
|---|---|---|
| `A los fines de este Artículo` | 16 | 0 |
| `A los fines de este Capítulo` | 5 | 2 |
| `A los fines de esta Ley` | 101 | 51 |
| `A los fines de este Título` | 1 | 0 |
| `A los fines de este inciso` | 7 | 1 |
| `A los fines de este apartado` | 13 | 2 |
| `A los fines de esta sección` | 15 | 1 |
| `Para los fines de` (general) | 224 | 33 |
| `Para los efectos de` (general) | 101 | 23 |
| `A los efectos de este Artículo` | 13 | 0 |
| `A los efectos de este Capítulo` | 5 | 5 |
| `A los efectos de esta Ley` | 58 | 30 |
| `A los efectos de` (general) | 256 | 48 |
| `Para propósitos de este Artículo` | 26 | 0 |
| `Para propósitos de esta Ley` | 99 | 65 |
| `Para propósitos de` (general) | 444 | 98 |

Note: an earlier pass of this survey had a regex bug (`[Aa]\s+los...` with
no leading `\b`) that let "Par**a** los fines de..." bleed into the "A los
fines de..." bucket via its own trailing "-a" — caught and corrected before
publishing (compare: uncorrected `"A los fines de este Artículo"` showed 31
corpus-wide / 0 canonical; corrected shows 16 / 0 — the canonical-column
verdict, the one the item plan depends on, was unaffected either way, but
the corpus-wide count was overstated by ~2x uncorrected). Real corrected
example, `STATE_PR_LEY_77_1957_ART4_140` (a "Límite de riesgo" article, NOT
Definiciones-headed): `"...(2) Para los fines de este Artículo, objeto de
seguro en lo que respecta a seguro contra incendio... incluye las
propiedades aseguradas..."` — a second real ad-hoc example alongside the
one used in the fixture (`STATE_PR_LEY_85_2018_ART9_04`), not vendored, but
confirms the phrase family is not a one-off.

**Citation grammar** (corpus-wide, n=23,636):

| Shape | Rows | Occurrences |
|---|---|---|
| `Artículo N de esta Ley` | 1,123 | 1,498 |
| `Artículo N de la Ley Núm. M` | 331 | 369 |
| `Ley Núm. N de <fecha>` | 2,194 | 3,459 |
| `Ley N-YYYY` (dash form) | 7,052 | 10,932 |
| `sección N de esta Ley` | 8 | 9 |
| `Capítulo N de esta Ley` | 32 | 53 |
| `§ N` (bare symbol) | 2,249 | 2,722 |
| `L.P.R.A.` | 2,498 | 3,042 |
| `sec. N` (abbrev) | 37 | 45 |

**Non-canonical inline-definition signals** (corpus-wide / excluding
canonical rows):

| Signal | Corpus-wide | Non-canonical rows |
|---|---|---|
| `(en adelante, "X")` | 49 | 47 |
| `(en lo sucesivo, "X")` | 1 | 1 |
| `denominado/a` | 182 | 171 |
| `conocido/a como` | 2,191 | 2,060 |
| `que en lo sucesivo se denominará` | 2 | 2 |
| `(por sus siglas en X, "Y")` | 155 | 120 |
| `(en inglés, "X")` | 5 | 3 |
| `mejor conocido/a como` | 110 | 103 |

`conocido como`/`denominado` are REAL but overwhelmingly law-title-naming
idioms (`"conocida como 'Ley de...'"`), not term definitions — sampled
examples confirm this; NOT recommended as a P2 extraction trigger without
much narrower gating (would need to distinguish "names a LAW" from "defines
a TERM", which these two phrases alone don't disambiguate). `en adelante`
sampled clean (both examples pulled were genuine term-defining appositions).

### Data-quality artifact (real, not injected) — title/text split mid-word

Verified on `STATE_PR_LEY_135_1979_ART1`: `section_title` (212 chars) ends
`"...tendrán el significado que a su lado se expresa: a) \"Oficina\":
significará la Oficina de Personal del Estado Libre Asoc"`; `text` (83
words) begins `"iado de Puerto Rico. Rev. 16 de abril de 2024..."`. The word
"Asociado" is torn in half across the two columns at whatever fixed-length
boundary the scrape used. Consequence: entry (a) ("Oficina")'s own
definition text is NOT PRESENT in the `text` column at all — no extractor
running over `text` alone can recover it. This is the PR analog of this same
fixtures directory's DE-mojibake and PA-collision findings: a genuine corpus
limitation, not a code defect, flagged for QA rather than built into an
item's acceptance test. 9/635 canonical rows (1.4%) share this exact
`section_title` > 120 chars artifact — see contract for the full list of
`act_id`s (in the pr_sample_rows.json README addition).

### Seam proposal and item plan

Published in the sprint contract's `## Seam proposal` and `## Next Steps`
sections (not duplicated here — append-only discipline, the contract is the
canonical copy). Headline for the core Planner: **PRProfile as a distinct
profile class, registered under `"US-PR"` only** — reuse audit against
`USProfile` found near-zero exploitable overlap at every layer (heading
regex, entry-marker splitting — PR bodies have ZERO newlines within a
section, breaking `USProfile`'s line-based splitter outright — citation
grammar, cross-law-derivation idioms), and the distinct-class option gives
gate P5 a type-level (registry-keying) guarantee instead of relying solely
on an internal `if self.code == "US-PR"` branch inside otherwise-shared
code.

### RED test proof

Six new files under `backend/tests/unit/`:
`test_pr_profile_headings.py`, `test_pr_profile_extraction.py`,
`test_pr_profile_ad_hoc_definitions.py`, `test_pr_profile_citations.py`,
`test_pr_profile_no_english_regression.py`, `test_pr_profile_scope.py`.
Fixture: `backend/tests/fixtures/us_statutes/pr_sample_rows.json` (10 real
rows, README section appended documenting provenance and which shape each
row proves), plus the existing `de_sample_rows.json` reused unmodified for
the P5 English-regression file (no new DE fixture needed).

```
$ backend/.venv/bin/pytest backend/tests/unit/test_pr_profile_headings.py \
    backend/tests/unit/test_pr_profile_extraction.py \
    backend/tests/unit/test_pr_profile_ad_hoc_definitions.py \
    backend/tests/unit/test_pr_profile_citations.py \
    backend/tests/unit/test_pr_profile_no_english_regression.py \
    backend/tests/unit/test_pr_profile_scope.py --continue-on-collection-errors -q
...
ERROR backend/tests/unit/test_pr_profile_ad_hoc_definitions.py
ERROR backend/tests/unit/test_pr_profile_citations.py
ERROR backend/tests/unit/test_pr_profile_extraction.py
ERROR backend/tests/unit/test_pr_profile_headings.py
ERROR backend/tests/unit/test_pr_profile_no_english_regression.py
6 xfailed, 5 errors in 0.04s
```

Every `ERROR` is `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named
'app.definition_links.pr_profile'` — the exact same legitimate RED signal
the 2026-08-02 sprint's `test_definition_links_us_profile.py` used before
`USProfile` existed (precedent read via CodeGraph before writing these
tests). `test_pr_profile_scope.py`'s 6 tests `xfail` cleanly (not error) —
by design, since P3 is explicitly core-seam-gated and the file's own
`pytestmark` documents why.

Full existing suite re-run to confirm no regression from the new files
themselves (README edit, new fixture, 6 new test files — no production code
touched):

```
$ backend/.venv/bin/pytest backend/tests --continue-on-collection-errors -q
...
641 passed, 6 xfailed, 18 warnings, 5 errors in 13.69s
```

641 passed matches the pre-existing baseline exactly (repo-profile.md's
"2026-08-02: 504/504" note is stale per that same file's own caveat — 641 is
this worktree's real current count, unaffected by this pass).

### For the Developer (sequencing)

Items 1/2/4 (+ item 3's two functions, NOT their pipeline wiring) and item
6 (the `PRProfile` class itself, NOT registry wiring) are pre-core OK —
start there. Items 5 (scope), 7 (registry), and item 3's pipeline wiring
wait on `2026-08-04-defs-core-scope` publishing its seam spec; item 8 (full
pipeline E2E test) is not yet authored and is flagged to the manager as this
sprint's next planning increment once core lands, not silently treated as
covered by the current six files.

### For QA

The survey's measured signal tables above are the ground truth for gate
P4's zero-miss sweep — please sweep the full 23,636-row file against them
(idiom list, marker shapes, scope phrases, citation grammar, non-canonical
signals), not just against the 10 vendored fixture rows. Two explicit
residual-risk flags from this survey worth independent verification: (a)
the 174/635 canonical rows with no genuine multi-entry marker (may hide
marker shapes this survey didn't catalogue), and (b) `conocido como`/
`denominado` (real signals, but overwhelmingly law-title-naming rather than
term-defining in this survey's sample — worth QA's own independent check
before anyone is tempted to add them as a P2 trigger).

### Escalations

None. No panel-level conflict of the P-R2 class (zero-miss vs.
zero-false-positive) was hit in this pass — `conocido como`/`denominado`
came close (real signal, high false-positive risk) but this Planner's own
lean (exclude from this pass's item plan, flag for QA/future follow-up
rather than build a narrow-enough gate blind) did not require director-
level arbitration; recorded as a documented follow-up instead, not a
silent drop.

## 2026-08-04 — Manager: verification of the Planner handoff (ACCEPTED)

I do not accept "the Planner said so". Everything below is a check I ran
myself in this worktree against the real corpus and the real code.

**Role boundary — HELD.** `git diff --name-only 969140d...HEAD | grep -E
'^backend/app/|^frontend/src/'` returns NOTHING. Ten files changed: 6 new
test files, 1 new fixture, 1 purely-additive fixtures README (`--numstat`:
`99 0`, zero deletions), contract, log. No existing test was edited — the
program's standing "editing an existing test to fit is a planning bug"
constraint is satisfied by construction, not by assertion.

**Fixtures are REAL, verbatim corpus rows — verified, not trusted.** I read
`us_pr_statutes.parquet` directly and compared all 10 vendored rows on BOTH
`section_title` and `text`:

```
EXACT MATCH: STATE_PR_LEY_249_2003_ART3 / _63_2023_ART3 / _77_1957_ART30_020
             _77_1957_ART1_090 / _85_2018_ART9_04 / _160_2013_ART5_4
             _165_2020_ART1_2 / _135_1979_ART1 / _15_2024_ART3 / _70_1997_ART1
RESULT: 10 exact, 0 problems, of 10 fixture rows
```

Nothing was paraphrased, cleaned, or invented — including the ugly ones (the
truncated-mid-word `STATE_PR_LEY_135_1979_ART1` title artifact is real).
This mattered: a Spanish-language sprint is exactly where a fabricated
fixture would be hardest to spot by eye.

**Survey headline numbers — independently reproduced.** My own script, my
own regex, no reference to the Planner's code:

```
rows: 23636
section_title contains 'defini':                    652
of those, matching stem definici(on|ones):          635   <- Planner: 635
excluded (no stem):                                  17   <- Planner: 17
genuine-heading rows whose BODY contains a newline:   0
ANY corpus row whose body contains a newline:         0   <- structural claim CONFIRMED
rows with mojibake markers:                           0   <- PR does NOT share RI's defect
genuine PR Definiciones headings recognized by CURRENT code: 0 / 635
```

Three consequences I am treating as established fact for the rest of this
sprint: (1) the recon's "~529 Definiciones headings" undercounted — it is
**635**; (2) the before-rate for gate P4 really is **0/635**, so the gate's
"before = 0" is measured, not assumed; (3) **zero newlines anywhere in the
corpus** means `USProfile`'s line-based `_split_into_numbered_blocks` is not
merely mis-vocabularied for Spanish, it is structurally inapplicable. That
third point is the strongest single argument in the seam proposal and it
holds up.

**Idiom counts — reconciled, one immaterial delta.** The Planner's counts
did not match my first (case-sensitive substring) pass, so I re-ran under
three counting methods to find out why rather than reporting a discrepancy
I hadn't explained. Case-insensitive word-boundary counting reproduces
**6 of 7** exactly (`significa` 596, `tendrán el significado` 309, `tendrá
el significado` 15, `se entenderá por` 62, `quiere decir` 7, `se entiende
por` 15). The seventh, `significará`, is **337 by my count vs. 340
reported** — a 0.9% delta, immaterial to rule design and to every
conclusion drawn from it. Recorded here so QA does not re-discover it as a
mystery; QA should feel free to re-derive rather than inherit.

The survey's load-bearing NEW finding survives verification: the
`tendrá(n) el/los significado(s)` family (309 rows for one variant alone,
exact match) is co-dominant with `significa` and was **absent from the
recon's lead entirely**. Ruling M-R2 (own survey, not the recon's list) paid
for itself — had the panel built to the recon's inventory, this sprint would
have shipped a large silent miss straight through a zero-miss gate.

**RED proof — re-run by me, not quoted from the Planner.**

```
$ backend/.venv/bin/pytest backend/tests --continue-on-collection-errors -q
641 passed, 6 xfailed, 18 warnings, 5 errors in 13.58s
ERROR ...test_pr_profile_{headings,extraction,citations,ad_hoc_definitions,no_english_regression}.py
```

And the baseline, with the six new files excluded, to prove the 641 are
pre-existing and untouched:

```
$ backend/.venv/bin/pytest backend/tests -q --ignore=<the 6 new files>
641 passed, 18 warnings in 13.48s
```

So: baseline 641 passed / 0 xfailed, unchanged; all 6 new xfails are the
core-gated P3 scope tests; 5 files RED via `ModuleNotFoundError`.

**Manager's caveat on the RED signal.** `ModuleNotFoundError` is a *weak*
red — it proves the module is absent, not that each assertion discriminates.
I therefore read every test body rather than trusting the count. They are
substantive: exact candidate counts (9/6/6/1) against named real Spanish
terms, a guard that entry (c) re-quoting its own term must not swallow entry
(d), false-positive guards on real `Aportaciones Definidas` and a real
table-of-contents heading, and — for P5/M-R4 — the real Delaware fixture fed
through `PRProfile` directly. The P5 test would genuinely fail if the
Spanish rules were made language-blind, because the English word
"Definitions" contains the substring `defin`; that is the collision M-R4
exists to catch, and it is now pinned. **M-R4 satisfied.**

**Verdict: Planner handoff ACCEPTED.** Item plan (9 items) frozen as the
sprint's scope. Honest gap the Planner flagged rather than hid: item 8, the
end-to-end `run_definition_linking` live-path test, is NOT yet authored and
is sequenced after core — I am carrying that forward as an open obligation,
not a completed item.

### Manager ruling M-R5 — Developer proceeds now on seam-agnostic work

The seam proposal (`PRProfile` as a distinct class) is published on this
branch for the core panel to review per M-R3, and I am relaying it to the
program manager. I am **not** stalling the sprint on that review, because
the work splits cleanly:

- The Spanish RULE LOGIC — heading stem detector, continuous-string entry
  extractor, local/ad-hoc extractors, citation grammar — is identical under
  BOTH seam options. It lives in a NEW module (`pr_profile.py`), touches no
  shared file, and is buildable today. Items 1, 2, 3 (functions), 4, 6.
- Only REGISTRATION differs between the options, and registration is a
  shared-module edit (`profiles.py::_REGISTRY`) that M-R3 already forbids
  before core publishes. Items 5, 7, 8 stay parked.

Residual risk, stated plainly: if the core panel rejects the distinct-class
proposal, the `PRProfile` wrapper and the tests' import surface get rehomed.
That is roughly the wrapper plus import lines — the rule functions and every
assertion about Spanish behavior survive untouched. I judge that cheaper
than idling an entire implementation phase behind a review I cannot
synchronously obtain. Recorded as a deliberate trade, not an oversight.
